				<h1>The World of <br> Charles &amp; Ray Eames</h1>

				<p>With a grand sense of adventure, Charles and Ray Eames turned their curiosity and boundless enthusiasm into creations that established them as a truly great husband and wife design team. Their unique synergy led to a whole new look in furniture. Lean and modern. Playful and functional. Sleek, sophisticated and beautifully simple. That was and is the "Eames look".</p>

				<p>That look and their relationship with Herman Miller started with moulded plywood chairs in the late 1940s and included the world-renowned Eames lounge chair, now in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York.</p>

				<p>Charles and Ray achieved their monumental success by approaching each project the same way: Does it interest and intrigue us? Can we make it better?</p>

				<p class="personal-quote">&ldquo;Choose your corner, pick away at it carefully, intensely &amp; that way, you might change the world&rdquo; <br> <span>- Charles Eames</span></p>

				<p>They loved their work, which was a combination of art and science, design and architecture, process and product, style and function. &ldquo;The details are not details&rdquo;, said Charles. &ldquo;They make the product&rdquo;.</p>

				<p>Their own concepts evolved over time, not overnight. As Charles noted about the development of the Moulded Plywood Chairs, &ldquo;Yes, it was a flash of inspiration&rdquo;, he said, &ldquo;a kind of 30-year flash&rdquo;.</p>

				<p>A design critic once said that this extraordinary couple &ldquo;just wanted to make the world a better place&rdquo;. That they did. That also made it a lot more interesting.</p>
